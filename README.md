# CSE101 Computer C Programming

Welcome to the CSE101 Computer C Programming repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of codes developed throughout my journey in the CSE101 course. It includes project codes, class codes, and practice exercises, offering a complete overview of the concepts and applications learned during the course.

## Repository Structure

- **Project Codes**: This folder contains the complete source code of my C programming project. The project was designed to apply the concepts learned in the course to solve a real-world problem.

- **Class Codes**: Here, you'll find the codes written during classroom sessions. These codes demonstrate various C programming concepts as taught in the lectures.

- **Practice Codes**: This section includes additional practice problems and their solutions. These codes helped reinforce the concepts and improve my understanding of C programming.

## Getting Started

To explore the codes:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aaditya-Kumar-Mittal/CSE101-Computer-C-Programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of interest (Project Codes, Class Codes, or Practice Codes).
3. Open the files in your preferred text editor or IDE to explore the code.

## Requirements

To compile and run the codes, you'll need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A text editor or an IDE like Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion.

## How to Use

1. **Compilation**: Compile the C files using the GCC compiler.

   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ```

2. **Execution**: Run the compiled program.

   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
